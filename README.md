# The Clean Coder
This will contain personal list of interesting things, opinions and key takeaways from book The Clean Coder by Rober C. Martin.
Content will not be structured similar how the book is strucured.


## Overview
Book itself is trying to define term professional programmer. What it means, how should this person behave, communicate, make decisions, commit to things as well as learning some useful habits. Author also want from reader to learn from his many mistakes that he did during his career.

## Professionalism
Professional is defined a person that should meets these criteria:

### Learn and educate continuously
Programmer should always keep learning new things that are outside of his comfort zone. IT industry is changing very fast so it can easily happen that after few years your knowledge becomes obsolete and you will not going to keep up with your other pears. Professional programmer should educate beyond stuff in work, he should not take free books, conferences from employer as standard, but rather the favor. You should find a way to take extra time beyond work and continuously educate/learn new stuff. This should be something that you consider fun to try/learn, otherwise it can be  recipe for burnout.
### Be committed
Professional should be committed to statements that he say. he should be aware that phrases like "I should" "I need" , "I hope" are clear sign of lack of commitment. Therefore you should not use these, but rather use "I will" ... "by".. "date". Professional is not required to always say "yes". He should find a "creative" way to make it work or otherwise say "no"
### Say no
Professional have courage to say no to manager, Both manager and programmer should defend their ideas and key points and find mutual agreement/alternative. When defending your ETAs do not try to explain why some "feature" take longer to implement while it is not necessary, because it can lead to micro managing of things and arguing about petty things.
More in stake it is, more important is to say no, you should stand our for your reasoning. Do not get tricked by saying "I will try" when management is pushing on you or definitely do not try to be a "hero" that saved the deadline. You will mostly do not make it. And when management will look for someone to blame, be sure that it will be you. Even if you make it will cost you nerves, overtimes and person life costs.
### Know the domain
When working on new project/feature you should understand the domain that you will be working on. Read a book about it, meet with people they understand it, to make sure that you implement solution that users really need.

### Take responsibility /  being team player
I think that these two qualities are self explanatory and do not need to take deeper explanation.
